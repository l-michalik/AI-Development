  <summary>Description</summary>
  The program is designed to train a model in Python that utilizes a recurrent neural network to generate poetic texts similar to those of Shakespeare. The goal of the program is to achieve the best possible results in terms of generating high-quality poetic texts. Interestingly, the program has been found to achieve better results when the precision is set to 20%, which is somewhat surprising given that it performs better at this level than it does at 100% precision.
