  <summary>Description</summary>
  The program is designed to create a model using Python that can recognize freely selected images from the web and mark them with a specific class name. To train the model, the developer used 20,000 images, and after the training process, the program is now working accurately. The accuracy of the program was tested on three images downloaded from Pixabay, and the predictions were found to be correct.
  In summary, the program is a Python-based image recognition model that can accurately identify and label images from the web with a specific class name. The model was trained using 20,000 images, and the accuracy of the program was tested and confirmed on three images downloaded from Pixabay.

## 1. recurrent-neural-network
<details>
  <summary>Description</summary>
  The program is designed to train a model in Python that utilizes a recurrent neural network to generate poetic texts similar to those of Shakespeare. The goal of the program is to achieve the best possible results in terms of generating high-quality poetic texts. Interestingly, the program has been found to achieve better results when the precision is set to 20%, which is somewhat surprising given that it performs better at this level than it does at 100% precision.
