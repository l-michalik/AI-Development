## 4. sentiment-polarity
<details>
  <summary>Description</summary>
  In my program, I have integrated a sentiment analysis module that distinguishes between positive and negative text. Yet, when faced with ambiguous content, the program may encounter challenges in determining the sentiment accurately. To address this limitation effectively, I recommend integrating a text title analysis component to enhance the overall sentiment assessment capabilities of the program.

## 3. s&p500-predator
<details>
  <summary>Description</summary>
  I have developed a sophisticated model that utilizes data from the S&P 500 to forecast stock prices in the market. While there are numerous enhancements that can be implemented to optimize the effectiveness of this solution, my primary focus is on acquiring the necessary knowledge and skills to maximize its potential. Currently, I am investing in the Vanguard S&P 500 index, and I view this as a foundational step towards achieving success in this field. By building a strong understanding of the fundamentals and continuously improving my expertise, I aim to leverage this model to make informed and profitable investment decisions in the future. The model currently boasts an accuracy rate of 57.3%.

## 2. img-classification-neural-network
<details>
  <summary>Description</summary>
  The program is designed to create a model using Python that can recognize freely selected images from the web and mark them with a specific class name. To train the model, the developer used 20,000 images, and after the training process, the program is now working accurately. The accuracy of the program was tested on three images downloaded from Pixabay, and the predictions were found to be correct.

## 1. recurrent-neural-network
<details>
  <summary>Description</summary>
  The program is designed to train a model in Python that utilizes a recurrent neural network to generate poetic texts similar to those of Shakespeare. The goal of the program is to achieve the best possible results in terms of generating high-quality poetic texts. Interestingly, the program has been found to achieve better results when the precision is set to 20%, which is somewhat surprising given that it performs better at this level than it does at 100% precision.
